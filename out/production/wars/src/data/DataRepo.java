            " the incursion would succeed only with air superiority. What followed was the first major campaign fought by opposing" +
            " air forces. For four months the German Luftwaffe carried out attacks on British airfields, radar stations, and aircraft" +
            " factories, and bombed British cities, too. But the Stukas proved too vulnerable to being intercepted and the Germans" +
            " couldn't mass enough planes to defeat the fighter pilots of the Royal Air Force in their Hurricanes and Spitfires." +
            " Heavy casualties forced the Luftwaffe to scale down operations. Hitler's invasion plans were put on hold indefinitely."
            , "When Britain and France declared war on Germany following the Nazi invasion of Poland, many expected that " +
            "war to be a retread of the infantry tactics actions of WWI. That line of thinking clearly led to the French " +
            "strategy of constructing the heavy concrete fortifications of the Maginot Line. Those expectations where shattered" +
            " in May 1940 when the Germans launched a fast-paced \"Blitzkreig\" (\"lightning war\") spearheaded by Panzer tanks." +
            " Lacking heavy artillery, the Germans attacked French positions at Sedan with massed Stuka dive bombers. The intense" +

            , "Following the D-Day invasion of June 1944, the Allies broke out of Normandy and advanced rapidly across France" +
            " and Belgium. Hitler aimed to halt them by a surprise Blitzkrieg. Several armored divisions massed in the Ardennes" +

            " So the Allies staged a massive amphibious operation to force the defenders to split their forces or be surrounded," +
